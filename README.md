### *Getting Started*
----------------------



In this repository, we are starting to learn about collabortive working and get more familiar with github.
At the beginning, we created this README.md file and fill it with information about ourselves.
Then each team member started to assign issues to each other and 
do them. Some merging conflicts were made and resolved by all team members.
